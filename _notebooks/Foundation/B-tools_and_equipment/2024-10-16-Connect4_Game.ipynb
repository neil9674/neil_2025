    "> - This unit covered many of the essential functions and operations within the coding languages, which will help me through my coding journey.\n",
    "> - Aside from coding, this lesson also thought me how to collaborate with colleagues in the real world. Considering that I want to work in the field of CompSci, I now know how to communicate with, and cross-integrate my work with other people coding at the same time."
