    "## Computers and Terminals\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief overview of Terminal and Linux is a step on your way to becoming a Linux expert. When a computer boots up, **a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started**. This kernel is the core of the operating system and manages hardware resources. Above the kernel, various applications run, including the **shell** and **terminal**, which allow users to interact with the system using a basic set of commands provided by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, casual users interact with the system through a Desktop User Interface (UI) that is started by the computer's boot-up processes. However, to interact directly with the shell, users can run a \"terminal\" application through the Desktop UI. Additionally, **VS Code provides the ability to activate a \"terminal\"** within its editing environment, making it convenient for developers to execute commands without leaving the code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next phase, we will use a Jupyter notebook to perform Linux commands through a terminal. The Jupyter notebook is an application that runs above the kernel, providing an interactive environment for writing and executing code, including shell commands. This setup allows us to seamlessly integrate code execution, data analysis, and documentation in one place, enhancing our productivity and learning experience."

      "\n",
      "Nighthawk Pages is a project designed to support students in their Computer Science and Software Engineering education. It offers a wide range of resources including tech talks, code examples, and educational blogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "GitHub Pages can be customized by the blogger to support computer science learnings as the student works through the pathway of using Javascript, Python/Flask, Java/Spring.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Student Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "Del Norte HS students will be required to review their personal GitHub Pages at each midterm and final.  This review will contain a compilation of personal work performed within each significant grading period.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, Students and Teachers are expected to use GitHub pages to build lessons, complete classroom hacks, perform work on JavaScript games, and serve as a frontend to full-stack applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exchange of information could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. sharing a file:  `wget \"raw-link.ipynb\"\n",
      "2. creating a template from this repository\n",
      "3. sharing a fork among team members\n",
      "4. etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## History\n",
      "\n",
      "This project is in its 3rd revision (aka 3.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "The project was initially based on Fastpages. But this project has diverged from those roots into an independent entity.  The decision to separate from Fastpages was influenced by the deprecation of Fastpages by authors.  It is believed by our community that the authors of fastpages turned toward Quatro.  After that change of direction fastpages did not align with the Teacher's goals and student needs. The Nighthawk Pages project has more of a raw development blogging need.\n",
      "\n",
      "### License\n",
      "\n",
      "The Apache license has its roots in Fastpages.  Thus, it carries its license forward.  However, most of the code is likely unrecognizable from those roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Code Examples**: Provides practical coding examples in JavaScript, including a platformer game, and frontend code for user databases using Python and Java backends.\n",
      "- **Educational Blogs**: Offers instructional content on various topics such as developer tools setup, deployment on AWS, SQL databases, machine learning, and data structures. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive lessons and coding challenges.\n",
      "- **Tools and Integrations**: Features GitHub actions for blog publishing, Utterances for blog commenting, local development support via Makefile and scripts, and styling with the Minima Theme and SASS. It also includes a new integration with GitHub Projects and Issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Contributions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Notable Contributions**: Highlights significant contributions to the project, including theme development, search and tagging functionality, GitHub API integration, and the incorporation of GitHub Projects into GitHub pages. Contributors such as Tirth Thakker, Mirza Beg, and Toby Ledder have played crucial roles in these developments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Blog Contributions**:  Often students contribute articles and blogs to this project.  Their names are typically listed in the front matter of their contributing post.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## GitHub Pages setup\n",
      "\n",
      "The absolutes in setup up...\n",
      "\n",
      "**Activate GitHub Pages Actions**: This step involves enabling GitHub Pages Actions for your project. By doing so, your project will be automatically deployed using GitHub Pages Actions, ensuring that your project is always up to date with the latest changes you push to your repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "- On the GitHub website for the repository go to the menu: Settings -> Pages ->Build\n",
      "- Under the Deployment location on the page, select \"GitHub Actions\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**Update `_config.yml`**: You need to modify the `_config.yml` file to reflect your repository's name. This configuration is crucial because it ensures that your project's styling is correctly applied, making your deployed site look as intended rather than unstyled or broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "```text\n",
      "github_repo: \"student_2025\" \n",
      "baseurl: \"/student_2025\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Set Repository Name in Makefile**: Adjust the `REPO_NAME` variable in your Makefile to match your GitHub repository's name. This action facilitates the automatic updating of posts and notebooks on your local development server, improving the development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "```make\n",
      "# Configuration, override port with usage: make PORT=4200\n",
      "PORT ?= 4100\n",
      "REPO_NAME ?= student_2025\n",
      "LOG_FILE = /tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tool requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "All `GitHub Pages` websites are managed on GitHub infrastructure and use GitHub version control.  Each time we change files in GitHub it initiates a GitHub Action, a continuous integration and development toolset, that rebuilds and publishes the site with Jekyll.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- GitHub uses `Jekyll` to transform your markdown and HTML content into static websites and blogs. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).\n",
      "- A Linux shell is required to work with this project integration with GitHub Pages, GitHub and VSCode.  Ubuntu is the preferred shell, though MacOS shell is supported as well.  There will be some key setup scripts that follow in the README.\n",
      "- Visual Studio Code is the Nighthawk Pages author's preferred code editor and extensible development environment.  VSCode has a rich ecosystem of developer extensions that ease working with GitHub Pages, GitHub, and many programming languages.  Setting up VSCode and extensions will be elaborated upon in this document.\n",
      "- An anatomy section in this README will describe GitHub Pages and conventions that are used to organize content and files.  This includes file names, key coding files, metadata tagging of blogs, styling tooling for blogs, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Development Environment Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive start. A topic-by-topic guide to getting this project running is published [here](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/home).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick start.  A quick start below is a reminder, but is dependent on your knowledge.  Only follow this instruction if you need a refresher.  Always default to the comprehensive start if any problem occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Clone Repo\n",
      "\n",
      "Run these commands to obtain the project, then locate into the project directory with the terminal, install an extensive set of tools, and make.\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "git clone <this-repo> # git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student_2025.git \n",
